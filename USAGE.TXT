Notes on usage of Biome-BGCMuSo v6.2
______________________________________


Biome-BGCMuSo was developed from Biome-BGC v4.1.1 Max Planck Institute version, so extended command line options are not available that are implemented in Biome-BGC v4.2 [see master branch].
Usage of the model is simple. Using the example dataset [sample_input_data_HU-He2_muso5.zip] the simulation can be triggered from the command line by issuing the command:

muso s.ini

and then 

muso n.ini

[note that you have to compile the code under Linux first.

In the provided example [sample_input_data_HU-He2_muso6.2.zip] all files should be placed into one directory. 
Note that the input and outuput files are typically organized into sub-directories, as they are provided for Biome-BGC v4.2 in the master branch:
https://github.com/bpbond/Biome-BGC
If this solution is selected, then the subdirectory names must be indicated in the INI files. See the sample INI files in the master branch.

Note that we have developed an R tool to support the application of the model. The R tool is available here:
