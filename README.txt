Biome-BGCMuSo v6.2 biogeochemical model

Biome-BGCMuSo is a biogeochemical model that simulates the storage and flux of water, carbon, and nitrogen between the ecosystem and the atmosphere, and within the components of the terrestrial ecosystem. Biome-BGCMuSo was developed from the widely used Biome-BGC model that was created by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG), University of Montana.
